## Intro
Like so many, I begin each day with three things: coffee, an inspirational quote, and checking the weather for the day.  Rather than having to access three SEPARATE apps, this is my attempt to bring all of those to one place while also addressing the mediocre-cup-of-coffee pandemic ravaging mornings everywhere.


# Overview
But First… is an app that allows every user to:
1.	Calculate the perfect cup of coffee based upon their brew method and a tried and true formula used by specialty coffee shops around the globe.
2.	Get a morning “dose” of inspiration via the RQG (Random Quote Generator) which produces a quote from the user’s self-populated database every time the home page refreshes.
3.	Know the current weather as they look forward to the day ahead and consider things like what to wear for the day, etc.
Each user can navigate each section of the app seamlessly via the sticky nav at the bottom of the screen.  There is also a settings cog on the home page that allows the user to customize their app/experience.


# Project Goals
My MVP (minimum viable product) goals for this project were to accomplish the following:

* User-specific CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) as it relates to: Custom coffee settings/saved doses, etc. 
* Aesthetically pleasing design with coffee, a daily inspirational quote, and the current weather as the basis of the app.
* A randomly generated daily quote, fully functioning local weather display, and interactive coffee/tea dose/measurement calculator for the perfect “cuppa.”
* User login/registration.
